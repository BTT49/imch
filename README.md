Imch is a Python program that encodes hidden msg's in ur github pfp using steganography. as of right now it does not auto swap ur pfp even tho i would love that it only downloads ur pfp and encodes the msg in it, u have to manualy upload it to github. the code is written 50/50 by me and ai so is shit cus this is just a quick 3 am project. LOTS OF BUGS AND ISSUES.
